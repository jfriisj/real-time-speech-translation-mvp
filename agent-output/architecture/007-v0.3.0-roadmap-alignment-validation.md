# Roadmap Alignment Validation — Release v0.3.0 (Connectivity, Optimization & Speech)

**Date**: 2026-01-19
**Scope**: Validation of Roadmap Release v0.3.0 against System Architecture and Findings.

## Executive Summary
The proposed Roadmap Release v0.3.0 (Epics 1.5, 1.6, 1.7) is **FULLY ALIGNED** with the current System Architecture. The architecture has been preemptively updated (see `system-architecture.md` changelog 2026-01-19) to support the new components (Gateway, VAD, TTS) and data flows while preserving v0.2.x reproducibility.

## Alignment Matrix

| Roadmap Epic | Architectural Enabler | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Epic 1.5: Ingress Gateway** | `system-architecture.md` / Runtime Flows (v0.3.0) | ✅ **Aligned** | Architecture explicitly defines the Gateway -> Kafka ingress path, replacing the CLI-only hard MVP flow. |
| **Epic 1.6: VAD Service** | ADR: "VAD introduces a new segmentation event" | ✅ **Aligned** | The decision to fork a new `SpeechSegmentEvent` topic prevents breaking the legacy `AudioInputEvent` contract, ensuring backward compatibility. |
| **Epic 1.7: TTS Service** | ADR: "Speaker reference context propagation" | ✅ **Aligned** | The complex cross-cutting concern of voice cloning context is handled by a specific ADR mandating inline propagation (or object store fallback), preventing future blocking. |

## Key Validations

### 1. Latency & Performance (Thesis Alignment)
*   **Concern**: Adding VAD and TTS increases pipeline depth.
*   **Validation**: The introduction of VAD (Epic 1.6) is architecturally justified as a latency *optimization* (filtering silence > processing overhead). The `SpeechSegmentEvent` structure supports this by allowing smaller, denser payloads to flow to ASR.

### 2. Reproducibility & Benchmarking
*   **Concern**: v0.2.1 established a rigorous benchmark. Changing the pipeline could invalidate it.
*   **Validation**: The Architecture Master explicitly preserves the "Legacy/v0.2.x" flows. `AudioInputEvent` remains the canonical ingress. VAD is an additive consumer. ASR can be configured (via topic subscription) to consume either raw `AudioInputEvent` (legacy mode) or `SpeechSegmentEvent` (optimized mode).

### 3. Voice Cloning Feasibility
*   **Concern**: TTS needs data available only at Ingress.
*   **Validation**: Findings `006` and the resulting ADR in `system-architecture.md` provide the necessary mechanism ("Speaker Context" metadata in event envelope) to make this feasible without ad-hoc coupling.

## Conclusion
The architectural runway is paved for Release v0.3.0. No blocking architectural issues remain. The roadmap can proceed to Planning.

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to Planning for Epics 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7.
- Ensure Plan artifacts reference the specific ADRs in `system-architecture.md`.
