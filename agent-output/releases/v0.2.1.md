## Pre-Release Verification

### UAT / QA
- [x] QA Report: [agent-output/qa/004-traceability-and-latency-qa.md](agent-output/qa/004-traceability-and-latency-qa.md) (QA Complete, N=100 run logged)
- [x] UAT Report: [agent-output/uat/004-traceability-and-latency-uat.md](agent-output/uat/004-traceability-and-latency-uat.md) (UAT Complete, release approved)

### Version Consistency
- [x] Plan 004, roadmap release section, and release doc consistently reference v0.2.1; no service version constants required updates because this is a tooling-only patch.

### Packaging Integrity
- [x] Not applicable (no packaging artifacts or binaries required for this patch release).

### Gitignore Review
- [x] Reviewed `.gitignore`; no new ignores needed for the committed artifacts (docs, tests, QA/UAT reports) and the transient `latency_summary.json` was removed.

### Workspace Cleanliness
- [x] Working tree includes only the intended Plan 004 artifacts (probe script, baseline doc, QA/UAT reports, release doc) and no other unrelated changes.

## User Confirmation
- **Presented**: 2026-01-19T16:39:00Z — explained the release summary (probe success, JSON baseline, QA/UAT thumbs-up, roadmap update).
- **Response**: yes — Product Owner (2026-01-19T16:39:15Z)

## Release Execution

### Git Tagging
- Command: `git tag -a v0.2.1 -m "Release v0.2.1"` → Success (new tag referencing current main HEAD)

### Remote Push
- Command: `git push origin v0.2.1` → Success (remote tag now visible)

### Publication Verification Checklist
- [x] Local tag `v0.2.1` exists.
- [x] Remote tag `v0.2.1` is visible on origin (confirmed via `git ls-remote --tags origin v0.2.1`).
- [x] Benchmark doc [docs/benchmarks/001-mvp-latency-baseline.md](docs/benchmarks/001-mvp-latency-baseline.md) publishes the JSON summary and environment details.

## Post-Release Status
- **Status**: Deployment Complete (2026-01-19T16:42:00Z UTC).
- **Known Issues**: None observed.
- **Rollback Plan**: Run `git tag -d v0.2.1` and `git push origin :refs/tags/v0.2.1` to remove the release tag if required.
