# Release v0.1.0 - Shared Infrastructure & Contract Definition

## Plan Reference
- agent-output/planning/001-shared-infrastructure-plan.md

## Release Date
- 2026-01-15T18:55:32Z (UTC)

## Release Summary
- **Version**: v0.1.0 (Hard MVP skeleton)
- **Release Type**: Shared infrastructure + contract foundation
- **Environment**: Local/dev Kafka + Schema Registry stack
- **Epic Alignment**: Epic 1.1 — Shared Infrastructure & Contract Definition
- **Key Deliverables**: `speech-lib` package, local Compose stack for Kafka/Schema Registry, canonical Avro schemas, correlation helper, smoke test

## Pre-Release Verification
### UAT / QA
- **QA Report**: QA Complete ([agent-output/qa/001-shared-infrastructure-qa.md](agent-output/qa/001-shared-infrastructure-qa.md)). Tests: `/home/jonfriis/github/translation-engine/.venv/bin/python -m pytest shared/speech-lib/tests`, `/home/jonfriis/github/translation-engine/.venv/bin/python tests/smoke_infra.py`. Infra verification: `docker compose ps` shows Kafka and Schema Registry bound to 127.0.0.1.
- **UAT Report**: Previously marked “NOT APPROVED” because of `AudioProcessingEvent` vs `AudioInputEvent` name drift ([agent-output/uat/001-shared-infrastructure-uat.md](agent-output/uat/001-shared-infrastructure-uat.md)). Product Owner has since approved release authority for the canonical `AudioInputEvent` choice, so UAT is considered PASSED for this deployment.

### Version Consistency
- `shared/speech-lib/pyproject.toml` = 0.1.0
- `shared/speech-lib/CHANGELOG.md` documents 0.1.0 milestone
- Plan targets v0.1.0 ([agent-output/planning/001-shared-infrastructure-plan.md](agent-output/planning/001-shared-infrastructure-plan.md))
- Roadmap release v0.1.0 references the same Hard MVP skeleton ([agent-output/roadmap/product-roadmap.md](agent-output/roadmap/product-roadmap.md))

### Packaging Integrity
- Command: `.venv/bin/python -m build shared/speech-lib` (build succeeded; Setuptools emitted DeprecationWarning for `project.license` table syntax).
- No dist artifacts remain in the workspace (`shared/speech-lib/dist/` removed after verification).

### Gitignore Review
- The repository root currently lacks a `.gitignore` file, so there is no explicit exclusion list when running `git status`. Workspace remained clean after build, but adding a `.gitignore` (e.g., to cover `.venv/`, `shared/speech-lib/dist/`, etc.) would prevent accidental packaging cruft in future releases.

### Workspace Cleanliness
- `git status -sb` shows a clean tree after tagging; only the release document itself is new.

## User Confirmation
- **Release Summary Presented**: Hard MVP shared infrastructure (Kafka+Schema Registry + `speech-lib` contract helpers) is complete with QA validation; UAT risk (naming drift) has been acknowledged and owner-approved.
- **Response**: yes (Product Owner) at 2026-01-15T18:55:32Z UTC — release may proceed.

## Release Execution
- **Git Tagging**: `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"` (succeeded locally).
- **Remote Push**: `git push origin v0.1.0` (failed: `repository 'https://github.com/DIT-BRUGERNAVN/DIT-REPO-NAVN.git/' not found`).

## Publication Verification Checklist
- [x] Local `v0.1.0` tag exists (`git tag --list v0.1.0`).
- [ ] Remote `v0.1.0` tag visibility (pending; push blocked by placeholder repository URL).

## Post-Release Status
- **Status**: Tagged locally; remote push pending until real remote URL/credentials are supplied.
- **Known Issues**: Remote repository path shown in `.git/config` is a placeholder. `git push` will succeed once the remote URL is corrected or credentials/provider access is restored.
- **Rollback Plan**: Delete the local tag (`git tag -d v0.1.0`) and recreate once the release process can complete fully.
