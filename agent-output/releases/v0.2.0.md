# Release v0.2.0 - Core Services (ASR Service)

## Plan Reference
- agent-output/planning/002-asr-service-plan.md

## Release Date
- 2026-01-15T22:00:56Z (UTC)

## Release Summary
- **Version**: v0.2.0 (Core Services)
- **Release Type**: ASR ingestion microservice packaged for local Kafka + Schema Registry
- **Environment**: Local/dev Kafka + Schema Registry Compose stack on `real-time-speech-translation-mvp_speech_net`
- **Epic Alignment**: Epic 1.2 Audio-to-Text Ingestion from the roadmap
- **Key Deliverables**: ASR consumer/producer loop, wav/size validation guardrails, Kafka topic wiring, unit+integration coverage, Docker packaging, CPU latency benchmark, QA/UAT reports

## Pre-Release Verification

### UAT / QA
- QA Report: QA Complete ([agent-output/qa/002-asr-service-qa.md](agent-output/qa/002-asr-service-qa.md)) covering unit, integration, and benchmark commands.
- UAT Report: UAT Approved ([agent-output/uat/002-asr-service-uat.md](agent-output/uat/002-asr-service-uat.md)) confirming value delivery and correlation-preserving canonical topic flow.

### Version Consistency
- Plan 002 targets v0.2.0 and the roadmap release section for v0.2.0 (Epic 1.2) is aligned with this release ([agent-output/roadmap/product-roadmap.md](agent-output/roadmap/product-roadmap.md)).
- `services/asr/pyproject.toml` declares `version = "0.2.0"`, matching the release artifact.

### Packaging Integrity
- `/tmp/release-venv/bin/python -m build services/asr` builds the sdist/wheel for `asr-service`. Setuptools warns that `project.license` as a TOML table is deprecated; update to an SPDX string before 2026-02-18 to keep builds supported.

### Gitignore Review
- `git status -sb` was checked for new build artifacts; existing `.gitignore` already covers Python caches, build directories, and the added release doc. No `.gitignore` changes are required for this release.

### Workspace Cleanliness
- `git status -sb` still shows the implementer’s pending files/tests/docs (services/asr source + docker-compose + QA/UAT/implementation artifacts). Release tagging and packaging were performed against the last committed state; the working tree retains those changes for the implementer to commit separately.

## User Confirmation
- Release summary presented (`plan + QA + UAT + packaging`).
- **Response**: yes (Product Owner) at 2026-01-15T22:00:56Z UTC.

## Release Execution

### Git Tagging
- Command: `git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"` (succeeded locally on the current HEAD).

### Remote Push
- Command: `git push origin v0.2.0` (blocked by GitHub push protection: secret scanning detected a Hugging Face user token in `.vscode/mcp.json` from commit 92fc0fc08f713e22ec7c757df6e679c39d596c65). Resolve the secret or request an unblock at https://github.com/jfriisj/real-time-speech-translation-mvp/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/38J7IoiIvYbXmrUGjmHZyrxtnc8 and re-run the push.

## Publication Verification Checklist
- [x] Local tag `v0.2.0` exists (`git tag --list v0.2.0`).
- [ ] Remote tag `v0.2.0` visible (push blocked; no remote tag yet until secret issue resolved).

## Post-Release Status
- **Status**: Blocked — tag creation is ready locally, but remote push is prevented by GitHub secret scanning.
- **Known Issues**: Secret scanning flagged the Hugging Face user token stored in `.vscode/mcp.json` at commit 92fc0fc. Remove the secret or request an unblock, then re-run the `git push origin v0.2.0` command.
- **Rollback Plan**: Once the remote push succeeds, if we need to undo the tag, run `git tag -d v0.2.0` locally and `git push origin :refs/tags/v0.2.0` to drop the remote tag.
