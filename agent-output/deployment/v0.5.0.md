# Deployment 0.5.0

## Plan Reference
- Plan 028: Kafka Consumer Group Recovery Hardening (agent-output/planning/closed/028-kafka-consumer-group-recovery-hardening-plan.md)
- Plan 029: Test Infrastructure Hardening (uv-first, reproducible QA) (agent-output/planning/closed/029-testing-infrastructure-uv-first-plan.md)

## Release Date
- 2026-01-28

## Release Summary
- **Version**: 0.5.0 (hard MVP stage 2 release)
- **Type**: Service resilience + QA infrastructure hardening
- **Environment**: Local Docker Compose + GitHub release channel (code, telemetry, and tests only)
- **Epic Alignment**: Epic 1.9.1 (Service Startup Resilience Hardening)

## Pre-Release Verification
### UAT / QA Approval
- Plan 028 and Plan 029 both show `UAT Complete` and `QA Complete` in their closed artifacts (
  agent-output/qa/closed/028-kafka-consumer-group-recovery-hardening-qa.md,
  agent-output/uat/closed/028-kafka-consumer-group-recovery-hardening-uat.md,
  agent-output/qa/closed/029-testing-infrastructure-uv-first-qa.md,
  agent-output/uat/closed/029-testing-infrastructure-uv-first-uat.md).
- QA evidence covers the steady-state and cold-start smoke runs plus the uv-first workflow used to validate the release.

### Version Consistency Checklist
- `package.json` version is `0.5.0`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` lists `## 0.5.0 - 2026-01-26` as the latest release entry, matching the candidate version.
- `agent-output/roadmap/product-roadmap.md` marks the working release as `v0.5.0` in the Active Release Tracker and the release section.

### Packaging Integrity Checklist
- No binary artifacts were produced for this release; the deliverable is source-only.
- Smoke runs used Docker Compose with rebuilt services and the updated `tests/e2e/tts_pipeline_smoke.py` runbook to prove runtime impact.

### Gitignore Review Checklist
- `.gitignore` was not modified; no generated assets or build outputs leaked into the release bundle.

### Workspace Cleanliness Checklist
- `git status -sb` was clean before tagging (only the release commit on `tts-implementation`).
- All modified files are either documented artifacts or roadmap/plan records.

## User Confirmation
- **Timestamp**: 2026-01-28 18:20 UTC
- **Summary Presented**: Plans 028 and 029 are committed and the repository is staged for Stage 2 release (tag/push). The release will ship Kafka consumer resilience plus the uv-first QA workflow for v0.5.0.
- **Response**: "Stage 2 release" (interpreted as explicit yes to execute the tag/push/publish steps).
- **Confirmer**: User/DevOps requestor (per conversation context).

## Release Execution
### Git Tagging
