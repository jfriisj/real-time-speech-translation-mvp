arxiv:2504.18715v1,EXCLUDE,EXCL01,"Model-only; no distributed/event-driven/microservice architecture","Abstract describes on-device hearables system with blind source separation + localization + translation + binaural rendering running on Apple M2. Pipeline is ASR+MT+TTS but deployed as monolithic on-device system, not distributed/microservice architecture. No mention of event-driven patterns, microservices, messaging infrastructure, or distributed deployment.",10.48550/arXiv.2504.18715,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18715
arxiv:2508.13358v1,EXCLUDE,EXCL01,"Cascaded pipeline but no microservice/event-driven architecture described","Abstract describes integration of ASR (RNN-T) and MT for on-device streaming translation with latency optimization. Pipeline includes ASR+MT but is described as 'integration' and 'cascaded approach' without distributed/microservice/event-driven architecture. Focus is on linguistic cues and beam-search pruning (algorithmic optimization), not system decomposition, messaging, or distributed deployment. No mention of microservices, event-driven patterns, or distributed infrastructure.",10.48550/arXiv.2508.13358,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13358
arxiv:2406.02133v1,EXCLUDE,EXCL01,"On-device model; lightweight direct S2ST without distributed architecture","Abstract describes SimulTron, a lightweight direct S2ST model for on-device deployment on Pixel 7 Pro. Pipeline is end-to-end S2ST (includes ASR+MT+TTS implicitly) but architecture is described as 'direct' and 'lightweight' for on-device streaming, not distributed/microservice. No mention of event-driven, microservices, messaging, or distributed system patterns.",10.48550/arXiv.2406.02133,https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02133
arxiv:2110.08214v3,EXCLUDE,EXCL01,"Latency optimization in pipeline but no distributed/microservice architecture","Abstract describes latency reduction strategies for incremental TTS in simultaneous S2ST (ASR+MT+TTS pipeline). Focus is on upstream/downstream coordination (pseudo lookahead for iTTS, duration scaling) to reduce latency. However, no mention of distributed system, microservices, event-driven architecture, or system decomposition. Appears to be model-level optimization within a monolithic or tightly-coupled pipeline.",10.48550/arXiv.2110.08214,https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08214
arxiv:1509.09090v1,EXCLUDE,EXCL01,"Statistical MT pipeline; no microservice/event-driven architecture","Abstract describes statistical MT for real-time speech translation (ASR+MT in pipeline with synthesis). Focus is on MT model training (language models, tuning, evaluation metrics). Mentions 'pipeline with speech recognition and synthesis' but no description of distributed/microservice/event-driven architecture, component boundaries, messaging, or deployment infrastructure. Appears to be traditional SMT system.",10.48550/arXiv.1509.09090,https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09090
arxiv:2511.09525v1,EXCLUDE,EXCL04,"User study on spatial audio rendering; pipeline unclear and not architecture-focused","Abstract describes user study on spatial audio rendering for real-time translation in virtual meetings (ASR+MT+TTS implied). Focus is HCI evaluation (comprehension, cognitive load, satisfaction). No description of system architecture, distributed/microservice patterns, or infrastructure. Does not clearly describe pipeline with ≥2 of ASR/MT/TTS as separate components; may be integrated end-to-end. No architectural detail or scalability/robustness evaluation.",10.48550/arXiv.2511.09525,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09525
arxiv:2507.17527v3,EXCLUDE,EXCL01,"End-to-end product-level SI model; no distributed/microservice architecture","Abstract describes Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 as end-to-end SI model for S2ST with voice cloning. Pipeline is ASR+MT+TTS. Abstract mentions 'product-level solution' and 'duplex speech-to-speech framework' but does not describe distributed/microservice/event-driven architecture. Focus is on model quality (large-scale pretraining, RL), latency reduction, and voice cloning, not system decomposition or distributed deployment. No mention of microservices, messaging, event-driven patterns.",10.48550/arXiv.2507.17527,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17527
